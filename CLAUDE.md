# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A **template** for a VM-side daemon that polls a target GitHub repo, asks Gemini CLI to review open non-draft PRs, and posts `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` / `COMMENT` reviews as a GitHub App bot identity. There is no application to run from a developer checkout — edits here propagate to user VMs through `scripts/reviewer/sync-worktree.sh`, which fetches `origin/main` and `git checkout --detach` to the new SHA before each reviewer tick.

Implications for editing:

- The daemon runs on someone else's machine, often via cron or systemd. There's no local dev server or build step. The test suite is `scripts/reviewer/tests/run-fixtures.sh` (covers parser, CI-gate, prompt assembly, and Gemini invocation isolation); it runs in CI and is the canonical check for reviewer-core behavior.
- `sync-worktree.sh` **refuses to sync a dirty checkout**. Any new per-deployment config file under `config/` that isn't gitignored will brick every deployed VM on next tick. The ignored per-deployment files are `reviewer.env` and `required-checks.json`; only their `.example.*` siblings are committed. Adding another local config file means updating `.gitignore`, config resolution, setup docs, and `configure.sh` in the same PR. Personality gallery files in `config/personalities/` are committed verbatim; users select the posted style with `REVIEWER_POSTED_PERSONALITY=none|angry` (`linus` is a deprecated legacy value kept for old configs), and `REVIEWER_PERSONALITY_FILE` remains only a legacy/internal escape hatch.
- Forks/template instantiations rely on `.github/workflows/template-cleanup.yml` rewriting every `asavs/goobreview` literal to the new `owner/repo` on first push to `main`. Hardcode that string in new docs/scripts the same way existing ones do — don't introduce an alternate spelling, or fork personalization will silently miss it.

## Architecture

Three layers, executed top-down on each tick:

1. **`scripts/reviewer/run-once.sh`** — entry point invoked by cron/systemd. Sources `config/reviewer.env`, calls `sync-worktree.sh`, then `reviewer.sh`.
2. **`scripts/reviewer/reviewer.sh`** — the daemon body. Roughly: acquire `flock`; resolve the posted personality from `REVIEWER_POSTED_PERSONALITY`; mint a GitHub App installation token via `get-installation-token.sh`; list open non-draft PRs; for each PR, skip if already reviewed by `<app-slug>[bot]` on this head SHA (queried from the GitHub API); gate on required CI checks (`check-ci.sh`); download/cache a PR-head source snapshot; assemble a prompt from the personality file plus GitHub-side facts (PR metadata and author claims, commit subjects, check-run results, prior bot review, per-file diff with changed-file index and whole-file omission markers) and the GitHub review formatting rule; run `gemini` from an isolated empty runtime dir with the PR-head snapshot attached as read-only context; parse the final GitHub review event; post a top-level review; if `REVIEWER_RESEARCH_CONSENT=1` and the repo is public, save paired control/angry prompt+response artifacts without changing the posted review. The payload rule: never inline what Gemini can pull from the snapshot; always inline GitHub-side facts it cannot reach (the snapshot is a tarball with no `.git`). The composition is fixed in `lib/prompt.sh` (forks edit it to change the shape); per-deployment policy is limited to the posted style, research consent, `REVIEWER_INCLUDE_*` blinding flags, whether the model's thinking trace is prefixed onto the posted body (`REVIEWER_POST_REVIEW_TRACE`, off by default; capture into the sidecar, research artifacts, and agy transcripts is unaffected), and byte budgets in `reviewer.env`, the author username is blinded by default, and generated-file diff omission follows the target repo's `.gitattributes` `linguist-generated` patterns plus a built-in lockfile floor.
3. **`scripts/reviewer/get-installation-token.sh`** — pure shell, no Node on the hot path. `openssl` signs an RS256 JWT from the App private key, `curl` calls `/app` for the slug and mints an installation access token, `jq` parses; token + slug are cached in `$REVIEWER_STATE/app_token.json` until ~5 min before expiry. Also supports `discover <owner/repo>` and `discover-target` modes used by `configure.sh` to find the installation ID / sole installed repo. **GitHub App is the only auth path** — `gh auth login` was deliberately removed for distribution friendliness.

There's one Node script, off the hot path: **`scripts/lib/register-server.mjs`**, run by `scripts/register-app.sh` during initial setup **from Cloud Shell, not the VM** (so the VM never needs a Node runtime). It binds to port 8080 and serves a two-step page: (a) a link to `github.com/settings/apps/new` with name, homepage, description, webhook setting, and per-permission levels pre-filled as URL query params from `config/app-manifest.json` (same-origin GET, so the user's GitHub session cookies travel with the navigation in any browser), and (b) a multipart upload form that takes the resulting `.pem` and App ID. On upload it signs an RS256 JWT, calls `/app` to verify the key and fetch the slug, and writes `app-key.pem` + `app.json` to a tempdir; `register-app.sh` then `scp`s the key to the VM and pre-populates `REVIEWER_APP_ID` in `reviewer.env`. **Contracts here:** `config/app-manifest.json` follows GitHub's App-manifest schema field names (`name`, `url`, `description`, `public`, `hook_attributes.active`, `default_permissions`, `default_events`) because the server maps them directly to GitHub's URL-parameter names; don't rename keys. The earlier Manifest Flow (POST to `/settings/apps/new`, redirect back to `/callback?code=...`) was removed because cross-origin form POSTs to github.com lose the user's session cookies under modern browser SameSite policies, making registration unreliable from Cloud Shell.

State directory (`REVIEWER_STATE`, default `$HOME/.goobreview`) holds: `log.txt`, `lock`, `app_token.json`, `app-key.pem` (you provide, mode 0600), `gemini_backoff_until` (set by `set_gemini_quota_backoff` when Gemini emits quota errors), `sync.log`, `cron.log`. The transient runtime dir (`REVIEWER_RUNTIME_STATE`, default `/tmp/goobreview-runtime-<owner>`) holds the PR-head snapshots and, under `agy-runtime/`, the per-invocation trusted workspace (`agy-runtime/workspace/`, recreated clean each run and containing only the daemon-written `AGENTS.md`, attached to agy via `--add-dir` alongside the read-only PR-head snapshot) plus the build-tool refusal shims (`deny-bin/`), the thinking-trace sidecar, and mktemp scratch for agy's stdout/transcript parsing.

**Prompt layering** — there are two prompt inputs and they have different owners:

- `config/personalities/*.md` (**committed gallery**) — each file defines a reviewer's **role and voice**. The supported posted styles are `REVIEWER_POSTED_PERSONALITY=none|angry`: `none` maps to `config/personalities/control.md`, and `angry` maps to `config/personalities/angry.md` plus the affect-transcript prompt framing in `lib/prompt.sh`. `linus` (→ `config/personalities/linus.md`) is deprecated — superseded by `angry`, kept only so old configs keep resolving. `REVIEWER_PERSONALITY_FILE` remains as a legacy/internal escape hatch only when `REVIEWER_POSTED_PERSONALITY` is unset. Prepended to the diff and review-format prompt. There is no `personality.md` / `personality.example.md` fallback layer; `reviewer.sh` fails loudly if the resolved file is missing.
- `scripts/reviewer/review-prompt.md` (**engine, invariant**) — defines the minimal GitHub review event output contract. Parsed by `reviewer.sh`. Edit only if you're changing that contract.

Two contracts that span deployments — **never break these silently:**

- **Review event line**: the final non-empty line must be exactly `APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `COMMENT`. Malformed final events are dropped and retried next tick. Drift in `review-prompt.md` that changes this format will silently disable every fork.
- **Top-level review body**: everything before the final event line is posted as the GitHub review body. Reviews no longer include engine-owned metadata blocks or inline-comment anchors.

The engine prompt also tells Gemini to treat the diff under review as code, not instructions. Treat any new prompt-context injection point you add the same way — assume the content is untrusted.

Bootstrap flow (Cloud Shell path): `scripts/bootstrap-gcp.sh` creates a GCE VM, then SSHs in and runs `setup-vm.sh` from `raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/scripts/setup-vm.sh` (URL derived from this checkout's `origin`, which is why template-cleanup matters). `setup-vm.sh` installs base tools (`git jq curl wget tar openssl …`) and the Antigravity CLI (`agy`), configures a 2 GB swap file (for `e2-micro`'s 1 GB RAM ceiling), and clones the repo to `/opt/goobreview/example`. No Node runtime is installed on the VM — token minting is pure shell (`openssl`+`curl`+`jq`); the only Node consumer, `register-server.mjs`, runs in Cloud Shell. Then the user runs `scripts/register-app.sh` from Cloud Shell (the register-server hands them a pre-filled GitHub form, accepts the `.pem` back, drops it on the VM, and writes `REVIEWER_APP_ID` into `reviewer.env`), installs the App on the target repo via the link the server prints, SSHs in to run `scripts/configure.sh` (auto-discovers installation ID, writes the remaining config files), and finally enables cron or the systemd timer in `deploy/systemd/`.

## Common Commands

**Dev/test runtime is GNU/Linux (Ubuntu).** On Windows, run the commands below under WSL Ubuntu (or another Linux host), not Git Bash or PowerShell. The fixture suite fails loud without `flock` / on MSYS. Optional: `bash scripts/dev-env-check.sh` before fixtures.

```bash
# Optional: confirm GNU/Linux host tooling before a long fixture run
bash scripts/dev-env-check.sh

# Syntax-check all shell scripts and run the fixture test suite
mapfile -t shell_files < <(git ls-files '*.sh')
bash -n "${shell_files[@]}"
bash scripts/reviewer/tests/run-fixtures.sh

# Smoke-test the Cloud Shell registration server (mocks GitHub; network-free)
node scripts/lib/tests/register-server.test.mjs

# Validate example JSON
jq . config/required-checks.example.json

# Catch whitespace/conflict markers before committing
git diff --check

# Dry-run a single PR review against a real target (does not post).
# The artifact defaults to $REVIEWER_STATE/dry-run-<pr>-<timestamp>.txt (path is
# logged); set REVIEWER_DRY_RUN_OUT=/path/to/file to choose it explicitly.
set -a; . config/reviewer.env; set +a
REVIEWER_DRY_RUN=1 REVIEWER_ONLY_PR=123 REVIEWER_MAX_PRS=1 scripts/reviewer/reviewer.sh
tail -n 80 "$REVIEWER_STATE/log.txt"

# One full tick (sync + review) the way cron runs it
REVIEWER_ENV_FILE=$PWD/config/reviewer.env scripts/reviewer/run-once.sh

# Mechanical pre-merge gate for a PR (independent of the daemon)
scripts/reviewer/merge-gate.sh 123
```

## Conventions

- **Commit subjects describe the final state**, not the journey. Single-purpose; fold incidental cleanup into the feature commit rather than splitting it out.
- Keep `config/*.example.*` generic and safe to publish — they're the only config a fresh checkout has.
- Avoid adding runtime dependencies. The whole point of the shell-script + one-Node-helper shape is that it installs cleanly on a vanilla Ubuntu VM with `apt` + `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli`.
